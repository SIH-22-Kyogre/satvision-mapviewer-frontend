# SatVision: GUI Map Viewer - Frontend

- Visualization end-point to view processed satellite images overlayed on maps; backend-dependent application.
- Integrates [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for rendering processed overlays.
- This implementation interfaces with a Python Flask -based API backend, [defined here](https://github.com/SIH-22-Kyogre/SatVision_MapViewer-Backend).
- Visualizes landcover segmentation overlays generated by the backend through a novel `patchify-process-reconstruct` pipeline.
